The first time you compile the library from a fresh
checkout, you need to run the commands

 gtkdocize
 libtoolize
 autoreconf -i -s

gtkdocize installs some files needed by the tool we use to generate
the API reference manual. autoreconf calls automake, aclocal, autoconf
and libtoolize to create the GNU build system. You should not ever
have to do this step again.

Then run the configure script and 'make' as usual.
