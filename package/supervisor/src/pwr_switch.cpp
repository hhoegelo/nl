/*
	The detector works as an time integrator. Whenever the switch/button is pressed it ramps up an
	accumulator and when it is released it ramps down. This allows for significant switch bounce
	and aging contacts, notably with a pushbutton. 
	As long as a "pressed" state is present more often than a "released" state on average,
	the integrator will finally ramp up to the required PRESS_CNT which triggers an event.
	Therefore, the minimum press time to trigger is the value given below.
	If, say 2 out of 3 pressed states are missed because of an aging contact, the time until
	trigger will increase threefold.
